# Z3 Utils


## Class `Array`
Z3 treats arrays as unknowns to be determined. This class implements arrays in a more conventional form.
See example:
```python
def encode(message):
    message = Array(message)
    return [x + message[x % len(message)] for i, x in enumerate(message)]
```
It is difficult to recover the message given the output because how the message is encoded depends on the
message itself. However, we can use the `Array` class to make it a bit easier.
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    c = encode([ord(x) for x in "CTFSG{hello}"])
    s = Solver()
    xs = [Int("x" + str(i)) for i in range(len(c))]
    os = encode2(xs)
    for i, o in enumerate(os):
        s.add(o == c[i])
        s.add(xs[i] < 170)
        s.add(22 < xs[i])
    s.add(xs[0] == ord("C"))
    s.add(xs[1] == ord("T"))
    print("Computing...")
    solutions = eval_all_solutions(s, xs)
    for sol in solutions:
        print("".join([chr(x) for x in sol]))
    print("Done")
```
This code still takes almost a minute to run, but it produces the correct answer.

## `indexes` function
Usage: `indexes(indexer [z3 variable], array, expected)`  
Returns a condition that evaluates to true if `array[indexer] = expected`.
Example: picoCTF JS kiddie 1
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    expected = a2b_hex("89504E470D0A1A0A0000000D49484452")
    s = Solver()
    xs = [Int("x" + str(i)) for i in range(16)]
    out = encode(xs)
    for i, x in enumerate(xs):
        s.add(indexes(out[i], b, expected[i]))
        s.add(x < 10)
        s.add(x > -1)
    print("Computing...")
    for sol in eval_all_solutions(s, xs):
        print(sol)
```
In this challenge, a string of bytes is decoded using a keyed function to produce a PNG image.  
Given the input bytes and the decoding function, we can set a constraint on the key such that the first n bytes of output
match the PNG header. The additional knowledge that each character in the key is a number reduces the search space.

## `eval_all_solutions` function:
Usage: `eval_all_solutions(solver, inputs, limit=-1)`  
By default, there is no limit to number of solutions.  
This functions returns a generator. 
See examples above for usage.
